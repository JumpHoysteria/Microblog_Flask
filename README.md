# Microblog

In this repository, I'm going to replicate [Miguel Grinbergs Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

Currently (25.02.19) I'm on chapter 2.

## Motivation

My girlfriend and I want to initialize the website for our student's association! 


## Assumptions
We don't expect, that after us there will be many interested students to take care of this webpage. That's why we wanted to build a product that can sustain for some time without much maintenance. Also we want to leave a product that is extensively documented, such that it could be replicated. Furthermore, if future issues are encountered, debugging should be not time-intensive.

## Project Comittments

### Front End

[VueJS 2](https://vuejs.org/)

Why?
* Sexy
* Relatively easy

### Back End

[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) FTW!

Why?
* Optimized for Documentation
* Stable
* Easy to understand

### Database

SQLAlchemy

### How to run this?
$ pip install -r req.txt
$ flask db init
$ flask db upgrade
$ flask run
$
